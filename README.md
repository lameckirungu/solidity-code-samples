# Solidity Code Samples
This repo contains Solidity code samples that I used to learn and practice contract development. Some examples are sourced from this [website](https://solidity-by-example.org), and I frequently refer to the [Solidity Official Documentation](https://soliditylang.org/).


## Getting Started 
The repository contains Solidity smart contract samples and exercises that cover various concepts in Ethereum development.

To get a local copy of this repository, follow these steps: 
1. Clone the repository: 
 ```git clone git@github.com:lameckirungu970/solidity-code-samples.git ```
 
## Usage
To compile and deploy the smart contracts, you can use tools like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or set up a local development environment with [Truffle](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/install/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/#tools).

#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following tools installed to compile and deploy the contracts:
 * [Node.js](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/install/#install-nodejs) - A JavaScript runtime used to execute development tools like Truffle and Hardhat.
 - [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm) - The package manager for Node.js, which is required to install dependencies.
 + [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) - The programming language used for writing smart contracts.
